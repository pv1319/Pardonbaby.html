  <p class="para1"> Baby,
      I genuinely love you alot it doesn't matter whom i talking with, whom i take photo with, what matter is that no one can replace you from my heart. I am bound to be yours for eternity, i will never ever leave your side. I have found you near me through every ups and downs, you didn't leave me in a single misery, you lifted me when i was sad, you made me smile when i cried, you filled my life with joys. You had never left my side despite seeing the situations. We have faced a lot of conditions like not talking for months due to your father's sware, We cried a lot for each other, But the main thing is that you were with me in each and every chaos, joys, laughter, romance, fights, sex and many more moments. You have loved me with all your heart despite being judging my looks and i will do the same, no matter what, i am gonna stick to your side till the last day of my life. How can i replace such a wonderful gift from my life that god spares his own personal time to create? Everyone will come and go but you will be here with me till the doom's day. I cannot say in words that how much precious are you for me, you never left me even when i had no hope to be something. So, please don't believe in myths that i am ever gonna leave you because that's not gonna happen for sure. You were, You are and You will be my wife for life. Don't compare yourself with those ordinary girls because that's an insult of you, no other girl in the whole world is like you. You are pure, kind, humble, lovely, cute, beautiful and gorgeous. Stay with me baby and witness our pure love for ages. So, that's it but i have just written 0.1% of your pureness, i cant just describe it in few words as it will take a notebook with a neverlasting pages and by the way my hands are also getting full because they are not that good in typing. Now, i am ending this. </p>
    </div>
      <p class="para2">
    So, baby please be with me for the rest of my life and i promise i will never do such things that i did before that made you cry, i will never do that again
</p>
<p class="para5">I am really really sorry for making you cry baby but i didn't did this intentionally. I will never repeat it again i promise, hence i am begging your pardon</p>
<p class="para3">
    I am on my knees and asking for your consent to be my wife.
